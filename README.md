# GooglePlayStoreEDA

### Project Description
This project aims to analyze the Google Play Store dataset to enhance engagement on the platform for both developers and users. The analysis involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and creating interactive dashboards using Power BI. The dashboards are designed to provide actionable insights for both the Google Play Store internal team and app developers.

### Dataset Description
The dataset includes comprehensive information about mobile applications available on the Google Play Store. Key attributes include:

  - App Name: The name of the mobile application.
  - App Id: A unique identifier for each application.
  - Category: The category or genre of the application (e.g., productivity, gaming, social media).
  - Rating: The average rating of the application on the app store.
  - Rating Count: The total number of ratings given to the application.
  - Installs: The total number of times the application has been installed.
  - Minimum Installs: The minimum number of installs required for the application to function.
  - Maximum Installs: The maximum number of installs for the application.
  - Free: Indicates whether the application is free or not (Boolean).
  - Price: The price of the application if it's not free.
  - Currency: The currency in which the price is denoted.
  - Size: The size of the application in storage space.
  - Minimum Android: The minimum version of the Android operating system required to run the application.
  - Developer Id: Unique identifier for the developer of the application.
  - Developer Website: The website of the developer.
  - Developer Email: The email address of the developer.
  - Released: The date when the application was released.
  - Last Updated: The date when the application was last updated.
  - Content Rating: The content rating assigned to the application (e.g., Everyone, Teen, Mature).
  - Privacy Policy: Link to the privacy policy of the application.
  - Ad Supported: Indicates whether the application is supported by advertisements (Boolean).
  - In App Purchases: Indicates whether the application offers in-app purchases (Boolean).
  - Editors Choice: Indicates whether the application has been designated as an Editor's Choice (Boolean).
  - Scraped Time: The date and time when the data was scraped or retrieved.

### Tools and Technologies
  - Python Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
  - Data Visualization: Power BI
  - Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook

### Dashboard Creation in Power BI:

#### Internal Team Dashboard:
  - Track developer engagement through metrics such as number of apps per developer, update frequency, and average rating per developer.
  - Track user engagement through metrics such as total installs, average rating, and rating count per category.
#### Developer Dashboard:
  - Track user engagement with metrics such as page views, installs, and average session duration.
  - Perform competitor analysis by comparing installs, ratings, and updates with competitors.

### Conclusion
This project demonstrates a comprehensive data analysis process, from data preprocessing to creating actionable insights through interactive dashboards. The insights provided by the dashboards are valuable tools for the Google Play Store team and app developers to monitor and enhance engagement on the platform.
